/** ---Legal-Will Form Documentation--- **/
By this application, Write a Will online and get peace of mind for you and your loved ones.

1. Create a Willed Account:
Create a Willed Account by answering a few simple questions.

2. Tell us about your partner and children:
If you are married or in a de facto relationship, tell us about your partner. If you have children, tell us about your children. If your children are under 18 years of age, you should consider appointing a guardian to care for your children in the event you and your partner pass away.

3. Appoint your executors:
The executor is the person appointed by you to carry out your wishes after you pass away. The duties of an executor can be demanding, so it is important that you carefully select people who you trust. Consider appointing a backup executor just in case.

4. Leave gifts:
Choose friends, family or a charity to receive gifts from your estate.

5. Divide your residual estate:
Distribute all of your estate (after allocation of specific gifts) to your nominated beneficiaries, which can be 1 person, a group of people or a charity. Consider appointing backup beneficiaries just in case.

6. Final wishes:
Let us know your final wishes, including your preference for burial or cremation.

7. Download, print and sign your Will:
Based on your answers, the Willed Platform will custom design your Will. You can then download your Will and follow our easy step by step signing instructions to make it legally binding.

8. Update anytime:
You can make unlimited updates to your Will, anytime from anywhere, for the first 12 months.
